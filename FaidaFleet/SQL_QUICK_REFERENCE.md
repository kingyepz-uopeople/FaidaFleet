ORDER BY total DESC;
```

### Expense Breakdown by Category
```sql
SELECT 
  category,
  COUNT(*) AS count,
  SUM(amount) AS total,
  ROUND((SUM(amount)::NUMERIC / (SELECT SUM(amount) FROM public.expenses WHERE tenant_id = ?) * 100), 2) AS pct_of_total
FROM public.expenses

  COALESCE(SUM(c.amount), 0) AS revenue,
  COALESCE(SUM(e.amount), 0) AS costs,
  COALESCE(SUM(c.amount), 0) - COALESCE(SUM(e.amount), 0) AS profit
FROM public.vehicles v
LEFT JOIN public.collections c ON c.vehicle_id = v.id
